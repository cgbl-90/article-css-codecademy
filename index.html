        <h1>A Short History of Dominican Republic</h1>
        <h2>The Dominican Republic, a nation on the island of Hispaniola, is a part of the Greater Antilles island chain
            in the Caribbean Sea. </h2>
        <p> The country, which ultimately claimed independence in July of 1924, occupies
            five-eighths of the aforementioned island, which it shares with the country of Haiti, making Hispaniola one
            of two Caribbean islands, along with Saint Martin, shared by two countries. In terms of both area and
            population, the Dominican Republic is the second largest Caribbean nation (after Cuba), with roughly 18,700
            square miles (48,445 square kilometers) of total land space an estimated population of 10.1 million
            permanent inhabitants, of which roughly one million lives in the capital city of Santo Domingo. The history
            of the Dominican Republic can be traced back to 600 AD, when the lone occupants of the island
            were the Taino people, an indigenous tribe of early Amerindians. On his 1492 voyage sponsored by the
            Catholic monarchs of
            Spain, the
            Italian explorer Christopher Columbus landed on the island, which soon after became the first permanent
            European
            settlement in the Americas, namely Santo Domingo, the country's capital and Spain's first capital in the New
            World.</p>
        <p>After three centuries of Spanish colonization, with periods of French and Haitian rule, the Dominican
            Republic became
            independent in 1821. The ruler of the region, José Núñez de Cáceres, was intent on making the Dominican
            Republic part of
            the nation of Gran Colombia, but he was quickly removed by the Haitian government and "Dominican" slave
            revolts. </p>
        <p>Victorious in the Dominican War of Independence in 1844, Dominicans experienced mostly internal troubles over
            the next
            seven decades, and also a brief return to Spanish rule. The United States occupied the country from
            1916–1924, which was
            followed by a relatively tranquil and prosperous six-year period under the leader Horacio Vásquez Lajara.
        </p>
        <p>
            Around 1930, the Dominican Republic found itself under the control of the ruthless dictator Rafael Leónidas
            Trujillo
            Molina, who ruled the country until 1961. The civil war of 1965, the country's last significant period of
            strife, was
            ended by a United States-led intervention, and was followed by the authoritarian rule of Joaquín Balaguer,
            the leader
            from 1966–1978. Since that time, the Dominican Republic has moved steadily toward representative democracy,
            and has been
            led by Leonel Fernández for most of the time after 1996. Danilo Medina, the Dominican Republic's current
            president,
            succeeded Fernández in 2012, winning 51% of the electoral vote over his opponent and ex-president Hipólito
            Mejía.
